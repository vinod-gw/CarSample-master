##Hibernate Setup
There are two locations to update the persistence.xml, which one is for debugging and the other for deployment. 
The domain objects will need to be updated upon adding.  

 1. resourceTemplates/webapp/persistence.xml 
 2. src/main/resources/META-INF/persistence.xml
 3. Run `mvn package -Ppostgres` or `mvn package -Pmysql` after changes.

##Deploy
When deploying, be sure to have the the persistence profile selected or integrated into the profile being deployed.

* For instance to deploy to the demos server, the postgres setup is integrated into the `-Pdeploy-demo` profile. 
    ```
    mvn clean deploy -Pdeploy-demo
    ```

##PhoneGap Build
Generically speaking the PhoneGap build wraps up the GWT module client side and builds a native version. No server side 
classes will be needed and can be deleted before zipping it and uploading it to Adobe Bd. We do this by exploding the
war file and deleting the server side and testing the web mode.

1. Run `mvn clean package`
2. Run `mvn resources:copy-resources jar:jar antrun:run -Pbuild-phonegap`
3. Find the PhoneGap zip in the target directory named `CarSample-Phonegap-Release.zip`

###Testing PhoneGap Build
1. Run `open -a Google\ Chrome --args --disable-web-security -â€“allow-file-access-from-files`
2. Run the `index.html` in chrome

###PhoneGap Upload
1. Goto https://build.phonegap.com/apps
2. Zip up app client side source only
3. Create development Android key like this. Do not loose your key. Do not forget your password/passphrase. 
    ``` 
    keytool -genkey -v -keystore brandon_donnelson.keystore -alias branflake2267@gmail.com -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 
    ``` 
4. Add key to adobe phone gap
5. Upload zip file of client side source 
6. Download and test the apk. Be sure the android sdk is installed locally. It can be deployed like this via usb. 
```
~/workspace-sdk/android-sdk/android-sdk-macosx/platform-tools/adb install CarSample-release.apk 
```

##FAQ

###Entity Manager exception occurs during Maven build
1. Check to see if the persistence.xml exists in target/CarSample-0.1-SNAPSHOT/WEB-INF/classes/META-INF/persistence.xml
  - Correct by running `mvn package -Ppostgres` is run.
2. Check the persistence.xml contains no variables like `${persistence.unit}`
  - run maven goal with -Ppostgres or -Pmysql or persistence profile with custom profile.
